ðŸš€ 3D Space Collision Detection with UI (Java)
A Java-based 3D collision detection system with a graphical UI to visualize object interactions in space. This project simulates and detects collisions between 3D objects like spheres, cubes, and custom shapes in a real-time environment.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… 3D Object Collision Detection â€“ Detects collisions between multiple objects in space.
âœ… Interactive UI â€“ Visualizes 3D objects and their collisions dynamically.
âœ… Customizable Objects â€“ Users can add, move, and modify objects in real-time.
âœ… Efficient Algorithms â€“ Uses bounding boxes, sphere collision, and AABB techniques for accuracy.
âœ… User-Friendly Controls â€“ Rotate, zoom, and manipulate the 3D view.
